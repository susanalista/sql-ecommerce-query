# sql-ecommerce-query

We have a data base from an e-commerce which sells products for health and wellness. The data base was originally a csv file which was converted to db in a previous notebook. Since we are focusing on SQL queries, we don't show the previous code for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and db conversion.

This is a descriptive screenshot for the different columns:
- created_at : timestamp of when order is created
- order_number : self-explanatory
- sku: unique reference for each product
- total_order_price: self explanatory
- code: the discount code applied to this order
